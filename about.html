            <h2>About the Series</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Understanding Power</strong> series provides practical, open-access guidance for public sector decision-makers engaged in the negotiation, financing, and regulation of electricity projects. Originally developed through a U.S. government initiative focused on African power markets, the series now serves a global audience.</p>
            <p>Each handbook is drafted and peer-reviewed by experts in infrastructure finance, law, regulation, engineering, and procurement â€” many of whom contribute their time on a pro bono basis. The handbooks are hosted here to enable broader access and deeper understanding for governments, utilities, regulators, and civil society actors around the world.</p>
